MySQL Replication Listener
=========================

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/BullSoft/mysql-replication-listener/master.svg?style=flat)](http://travis-ci.org/BullSoft/mysql-replication-listener)

A listener to fetch binlog from mysql server.

Reference:
 - Origin repo: https://code.launchpad.net/mysql-replication-listener
 - We forked from: https://github.com/wangmh/mysql-replication-listener

Install
--------------------
mysql-replication-listener uses cmake, so you need cmake first.

We use asio for socket communication, and it involes some **boost** libraries, so maybe you need install boost(1.47 and newer).

And then:

$ cmake .  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install

$ make

$ make install


Notice
--------------------
We need to make mysql server to dump binlog-stream to us, so we need **REPLICATION SLAVE** privilege.
And We need to get master status, so we need **REPLICATION CLIENT** privilege.

If you want to set_position to a specified binlog-file and the position, we need to ensure the binlog-file and it's position are legal, so we need to execute "SHOW BINARY LOGS" on the server. Unfortunately, 
   In MySQL 5.1.63 and earlier, the **SUPER** privilege was required to use this statement. Starting with MYSQL 5.1.64, a user with the **REPLICATION CLIENT** privilege may also execute this statement.

So If you use MySQL 5.1.63 and earlier, you need **SUPER** privilege too. 

Also, We auth privilege before binlog_dump, so we will access database **mysql** for accout checking... That means you have to give at least **READ** privilege for database mysql ...

Also notice that besides `log-bin` and `binlog-format` set in mysqld section, you should also set a `server-id` for mysql master.
